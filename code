    **What is Open Interest (OI)?**  
    Open Interest (OI) shows how many option contracts are still active at a specific strike price and expiration. It helps identify where market participants are placing their bets.

    ### 🧭 How to Read OI by Strike Price:

    - **High OI at Call Strikes Above Spot**  
      → Traders expect price to rise. This is **bullish positioning**, especially if those strikes show rising volume.

    - **High OI at Put Strikes Below Spot**  
      → Traders are hedging or betting on downside. This is a **bearish signal**, particularly when supported by growing volume or IV.

    - **OI Clusters Around a Strike**  
      → Indicates a battleground. When spot is near that strike, expect possible volatility or price pinning, especially into expiry.

    ### 📈 Bullish OI Example (with Numbers):
    - **BTC Spot**: $65,000  
    - **Call OI @ $70,000**: 3,200 contracts  
    - **Put OI @ $60,000**: 1,400 contracts  
    - **Put/Call Ratio**: 0.55  
    - **25D Skew**: -3.5%  
    - **Call IV**: 62%  
    - **Put IV**: 49%  
    ✅ Interpretation: Traders expect upside. Call OI dominates, IV rising on calls, and market is under-hedged.  
    🔧 Strategy: Buy calls or bull call spreads, or sell puts.

    ### 📉 Bearish OI Example (with Numbers):
    - **BTC Spot**: $62,000  
    - **Put OI @ $60,000**: 4,100 contracts  
    - **Call OI @ $65,000**: 1,800 contracts  
    - **Put/Call Ratio**: 1.25  
    - **25D Skew**: +2.8%  
    - **Put IV**: 68%  
    - **Call IV**: 54%  
    🚨 Interpretation: Traders are buying downside protection. Bearish skew and higher put IV confirms defensive positioning.  
    🔧 Strategy: Long puts, put spreads, or short call spreads.

    ### 🧠 Trade Guidance Summary:
    - **Bullish**: Calls > Puts, Skew < 0, Call IV > Put IV → Long calls, bull spreads
    - **Bearish**: Puts > Calls, Skew > 0, Put IV > Call IV → Long puts, put spreads
    - **Neutral**: OI centered at ATM → Condors, straddles

    👉 Combine OI with volatility, volume, and technical analysis for highest conviction.

# --- IV Explanation Section ---
with st.expander("🔍 Understanding Implied Volatility (IV)"):
    st.markdown("""
    **What is Implied Volatility (IV)?**  
    When reading an option chain, "IV" stands for **Implied Volatility**. It reflects the market’s expectation for how much the price of the underlying asset (e.g. BTC) will move over the option's life.

    - **High IV** means traders expect **large price swings** (more uncertainty).
    - **Low IV** implies **stable or range-bound markets**.

    ### 🧠 How to Use IV:
    - If **IV is high**, option premiums are expensive — better for **selling options** or using spreads.
    - If **IV is low**, options are cheap — better for **buying calls or puts** outright.
    - Track IV relative to historical levels (i.e. is IV elevated or suppressed compared to the past month or quarter?).

    ### ⚡ Example:
    - BTC at **$66,000**, 1-week IV is **70%**, 30-day IV average is **50%**.  
    - Market expects volatility — e.g. FOMC, ETF news.  
    📌 In this case: better to sell premium (e.g. iron condor) or use spreads to control cost.
